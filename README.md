# Defect-Detection-System
This project implements a defect detection system using a convolutional autoencoder trained on the MVTec AD dataset (bottle category). The system detects defects in images by reconstructing input images and measuring reconstruction errors.It includes a training pipeline ONNX model export, and a FastAPI-based inference API with data drift detection.
